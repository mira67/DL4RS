Caffe Learning Notes:
https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-read-the-source-code-of-Caffe

Usage
step1 :
data layer
convert data, LMDB using convert imageset

imagedatalayer
windowdatalayer

step2:
define net
proto.txt file

.prototxt can get ugly for big models
can use script to generate txt

caffe contains pretrained weights, finetuning
layer same name: initialized

step3: solver

step4: train

'-gpu -1' for gpu mode

-gpu all for multi-GPU data parallelism, without writing code, caffe will handle

caffe, model zoo, lots of models

Caffe, python interface
interfacing with numpy
extract features
run net forward/backward
define layers in python with numpy (CPU only)

no much document, read the code
_caffe.cpp: exports blob layer net and solver classes
pycaffe.py

pros:
good for feedforward

cons:
not good for RNN
cumbersome for big network, googlenet, resnet
need to write C++/CUDA for new GPU layers

resNet

concepts:
blobs
proto buffer from google


Torch:
C, Lua
Lua: similar to javascript, good for embedded system
