Train/Test Pipeline for Melt Pond Prediction with NN Models

[Prototype]
A simple workflow for basic NN model testings
  [Code Structure]
    train_main.py - load train/validate/test data
                  - train/evaluate/save model
    nn_models - file to write customized models
    get_data - file to prepare train/validate/test data
    prj_util - misc helper functions

Note: flow is not mature yet, need improve for targeted problems

Sandbox: Test and Play Codes, Results
