AMSR-E Paper:
[Estimation of melt pond fraction over high-concentrationArctic sea ice using
AMSR-E passive microwave data]

We propose a new algorithm for estimating the MPF as a relative fraction
of ice is from AMSR-E data (AMSR-E MPF). The algorithm is applicable to
areas with high sea ice concentration (more than 95%).
It cannot beapplied to areas of lower ice concentration as the
frequencies used are insensitive to salinity and
do not dis-tinguish between melt pond and seawater for cold water

Manual defined features:
Difference between Tb06H and Tb89V, regression 10km*10km

The AMSR-E MPF algorithm is useful in areas with high sea ice concentration
and MPF from 0-65%

89GHz can be affected by atmospheric cloud liquid water and water vapor on Tb.
(Using weather filters?)->
If (Tb36v-Tb18v)/(Tb36v+Tb18v)> 0.045, the grid cells are not included.
